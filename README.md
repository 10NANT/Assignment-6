# Assignment 6 – Searching and Maps

## Problem
The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate different ways to search for data using:
- linear search
- binary search
- maps

## Solution
I created a simple student ID lookup program.

- Linear search is used to find a student ID in an unsorted list.
- Binary search is used to find a student ID in a sorted list.
- A map is used to associate student IDs with student names for fast lookups.

Each method demonstrates a different searching approach.

## How It Works
- Linear search checks each element one at a time until the target is found.
- Binary search repeatedly divides a sorted list in half to locate the target more efficiently.
- The map uses a structure where the student ID is the key and the student name is the value.

The program prints the search results so it is clear what was searched for and what was found.
